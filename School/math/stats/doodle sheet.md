Two tailed test

we don't have a population distribution, must use T distribution

$t \approx -2.16457$

since this is a two tailed test & the t value is negative, the P value is double the area to the left of t,
`tcdf(-1e99, t, df) * 2`
$p \approx 0.0358$

since $p < \alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis

Because we rejected the null hypothesis, this means we reject that a healthy human adult's body temperature is 98.6, meaning there is significant evidence to support that the mean body temperature is not 98.6

left tailed test
$t \approx -1.598741935$
$p \approx 0.0641485511$

$p < \alpha$
reject null hypothesis

there is enough evidence to support the claim that the population mean weekly housely garbage is less than 36 lbs
