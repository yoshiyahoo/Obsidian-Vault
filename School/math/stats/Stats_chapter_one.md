## Starting Terms
**Population** 
* The group of people you are trying to collect data on
* These groups can be huge, so you'll need to get a sample
**Sample**
* The amount of people in the population you collect data on
* Good samples can make generalizations on the population as a whole
**Survey**
* The task of collecting data from a sample
**Data** can be
* Age
* height
* Averages
* etc

**Descriptive Statistics**
* Attempts to describe certain characteristics of data collected.
**EX:** In a survey of 400 students, it was noted that 40% of them use their cell phone cameras to copy lecture notes. The data was put into a pie chart. Here, the 40% of students using their cell phone cameras was descried in a chart (pie).
**Inferential Statistics**
* consists generalizing samples to then make predictions about populations in the future.
**EX:** The physics instructor has seen that the results of the final exam from 3 of his past courses were high enough. This made him put more challenging questions on exams for the next term. Here, the final exam scores from the past 3 courses are samples. These results have caused the instructor to change (i.e. make a prediction) for future exams.
## Types of Data
* **Qualitative Data**
    * Any data with labels or names
    **EX:** The names of fast food restaurants: McDonalds, TacoBell, Little Ceasers, etc.
* **Quantitative Data**
    * Any data with numbers
    **EX:** The length of cars (measured in feet)
* **Statistic**
    * A numerical measurement describing some characteristic of a SAMPLE
* **Parameter**
    * A numerical measurement describing some characteristic of a POPULATION
*   **Discrete Data**
    * The data is countable or FINITE
* **Continuous Data**
    * The data is not countable; INFINITE; always involves a measurement (inches, feet, meters, time, magnitude of an earthquake, etc.)
    
    **EX:** Determine weather the given data is a statistic or a parameter
        1. The average cost of a sample of 200 homes in Sunnyvale is 1.5 million dollars. STATISTIC, since this is a characteristic of a sample of 200 homes. 
        2. In a study, all 2,000 students said they stay up past 10:00pm on work nights. PARAMETER, since all 2,000 were surveyed
        3. The 50 states in the U.S. have lakes. PARAMETER, since it is referring to all 50 states in the U.S.
        4. In a recent poll, 300 people were selected randomly and interviewed about the earthquake. STATISTIC, since only a sample of 300 out of many more people whom experienced the earthquake were chosen.

    **EX:** Determine weather the data are from a DISCRETE or CONTINUOUS data set
        1. The height of the table is 24 in. Since there are infinitely many values between 0 & 24 in. this value is CONTINUOUS 
        2. There were 16 people in line at the supermarket on Sunday, since we can count the number of people in the line, this is countable data, DISCRETE
        3. The Voltages of various appliances were measured and recorded. Voltage is the energy per unit charge. This is a measurement. There are infinite measurements between 0v and "x"v. CONTINUOUS
        4. 

## Scales of Measurement (nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio)
**Levels of measurement**

**Nominal**
consists of names, labels, or categories. The data cannot be ranked (ordered).

**EX:**
1. The colors of poeple's shirts at a company on a given day
2. The 12 horoscopes

**Ordinal**
data which can be arranged in some order, but there is no numerical difference between them. (they are not meaningful)

**EX:**
1. Army ranks: private corporal, lance, sergeant, etc.
2. The top songs for a week on the Billboard.

**Interval**
data which can be arranged in order, and the differences DO have some meaning. No natural zero starting point, it can be anywhere.

**EX:**
1. The top highest paid celebrities ($10,000,000, $1,000,000,000)
2. The number of points scored by each player in soccer for a season

**Ratio**
data which can be arranged in order and the differences do have some meaning. There is a "natural zero" starting point (measurements)

**EX:**
1. The weights of a sample of fish, say 2lbs, 3lbs, & 10lbs, (0lbs means no weight)
2. The amount of time in minutes that it takes each student to complete an exam. (0 min represents NO time)

## Sampling Techniques
Simple **random sample**
* Have "n" subjects selected so that every possible sample has an equal chance of being selected

**EX:**
1. In a poll regarding beliefs UFO's in the U.S. a sample of 1000 adults aged 25 and up were selected.

**Systematic**
* select some starting point, and then select every "kth" element in that population

**EX:**
1. In a factory, to check the defectiveness of phone chargers, every 5 which came out of the assembly line were inspected (5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, etc)

**Convenience**
* user results which are easy (convenient to obtain)
    * potential biased sample here

**EX:**
1. In responce to the shooting, 4000 people who have been a victim of foul play were asked to participate in a survey regarding the trends in crime.

**Stratified**
* subdivide a population into at least two different subgroups such that the subjects within each subgroup share the same characteristics.

**EX:**
1. The instructor divided the class into 3 categories of majors: Science, Arts, and Trades. Then she selected 4 students from each of the three groups at random

**Cluster**
* Divide the population into sections. Then randomly select some of the sections, but choose ALL the members of them

**EX:**
1. Of the five professions: Enginerring, Law, Medical, Academic, and Government, TWO were selected at random; ALL members of these two selected groups were asked how their salary is.

## Studies
**Observational Study**
* observe, study the effects of an event and obtain certain characteristics. Don't attempt to modify it

**EX:**
1. A scientist recording the magnitudes of earthquakes over the course of one month
2. A bystander who withnessed a car accident.
3. Surveying a group of adults to ask them about their preference of smartphone brands
4. Taking a photograph of the height of a certain plant each day

**Experiment**
* Apply some treatement to the subject and expect some kind of a change or reaction (cause and effect)

**EX:**
1. A clinical trial for a drug was given to patients to see if their memory imporved
2. When the fireworks went off, the man was startled
3. In a study of three groups of students, one was given no prep for an exam, the second was given a little prep. and the third was given alot of prep. The scores of the exams from each of the three groups were then analyzed.
4. When the man was interviewed about his involvement in a scandal, he was infuruated.

## Variables
**Indepedent Variable**
* The variable that is changing. For example, time is always changing.

**Dependent Variable**
* This variable depends on the independent (changing) variable. It is also referred to as the "responding" variable. For example, the amount of money ($) you make on a job would be considred a dependent variable, sinc the more hours you work, the more money you make

**EX:** Identify which is the independent variable and which is the dependent variable
1. The amount of sunlight shining on the snowball gives us the diameter of it.
    Independent: Amount of sunlight since during different times of the day there could be more or less of it.
    Dependent: The diameter of the snowball, since this is changing (getting smaller and smaller) as more sunlight shines on it.
2. You are hungry from watching too many YouTube ads from avarious fast food restauraunts
    Independent: The amount of YouTube ads watched, the more you watch youtube, the more ads you see
    Dependent: Your hunger, the more ads you see, the hungrier you get
