#time_management
## Organize Your Environment
* Take control of your physical space
* When are you most productive?
    > I'm usually most productive in the mornings & in the evenings with the afternoon being the cooldown period
    > Source, Me. Josiah
* In what kind of setup
    > With busy work I'm usually alone, but with harder tasks having a buddy to help me out is always appreciated
    > Source, Me again. Josiah
* Find a space that you can focus on schoolwork
    * Have a plan B
* Motivation to learn is affected by your enviornment, make it ideal for you
    > Solitude, on my laptop, bright-ish lights, nice vibe
* Ask what your employer or teacher is ok with you doing
    * If they want you using certain software & nothing else, use it (yes it hurts but deal with it)

## Organize Your Course Materials
* Figure out if you like pencil & paper with paper copies or digital work
    > I prefer to work digitally
* If you want pencil & paper, find a nice spot to place those materials
* For online, find one device that you can store all of your notes on and use that
    * Make a backup of this!!!
* Online storage solutions include
    * [Icloud](https://www.icloud.com/)
    * [Box](https://www.box.com/)
    * [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
    * Amazon Drive, Look it up
    * Google Drive, Look it up
    * [EverNote](https://evernote.com/)
    * [Obsidian Addons](https://obsidian.md/pricing)
* Not all online services created equal, look carefully

## Create and Organizational Style
* Pinterest may make orgnaizing paper & pencil stuff easy (and maybe fun)
* For digital, figure out where you want to store your stuff
* Create descriptive file names that actually say what's inside of them
* Develop a version control system, Some files have different versions
* Example, essay_draft1, essay_draft2, essay_draft3, essay_draftFinal

## Organize Your Time
* Read the syllabus **carefully!**
* Create a calendar, or use a plannar
* Helpful online calendars
    * Google calendar
    * iCalnedar
* Schedule Assignments into the calendar
    * If you want to break an assignment up into managable pieces, do so
    * This will give you milestones you can track for progress
* Get an alert system to tell your lazy ass to get moving
* Do what best works for you!

## Develop A Study Routine
