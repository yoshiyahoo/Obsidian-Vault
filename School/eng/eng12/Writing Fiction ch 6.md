# Super Important Stuff
* Plot matters a lot (editors sending rejection letters means you're talented), no story is implied as no plot, they are basically synonyms
* Stories are like faces, they have qualities about them you can recognize instantly. Be specific about them
	* You must acknowledge the "in spite of" with faces, like a missing nose, same thing with stories 
* Stories are ultimately about change
* Story is events in chronological order, plot is events in order that reveals dramatic, emotional, thematic significance
	* The human desire to know why is just as important as to know what happened next
 
# Conflict, Crisis, Resolution
* One useful way of describing necessary features of a story
* Main character has to change in some way
* Drama = Desire + Danger
### Conflict
> Only trouble is interesting in literature
* Stories aren't stories without conflict
	* Protagonist must want something badly
	* Make roadblocks of that desire close to home, a non caring mother, unsupportive or abusive partner, something that deeply matters to the character
* Needs to get to a crisis point and then resolve, giving satisfying conclusion

# Ways of looking at plot
### Story Arc (warlike)
* ==Maybe== Think of story arc like a war over a specific piece of territory
	1. Get your fighters fighting
	2. have something, the stake, worth fighting over
	3. Have the fight dive into a series of battles, with the biggest and most dangerous one last
	4. Have a walking away from the fight

* Resolution is a permanent change in the story

> What does my character win by losing his struggle, or lose by winning?

### Power
* Protagonist fights antagonist in power struggle
	* Give antagonist enough to give reader doubts about the stories outcome
	* Power shifting back & forth makes story more complicated
* Power takes many forms, some of which have the external appearance of weakness

### Connection & Disconnection
* Connections between characters can also drive plot, not just war
* Conflict between honesty & honesty, love vs love, loyalty vs loyalty

# Form of a story
* Conflict
* Reversal, protagonist must in someway be changed or moved ==by the action==
	* comes about from a "mistake in identity", the reversal is the "recognition" of that mistake
		* epiphany is a crisis action in the mind, like a recognition
* Resolution
	* A resolution can be a war won't be resolved, or smth similar
