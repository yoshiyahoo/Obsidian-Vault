# Building Character / Direct Methods Of Character Presentation
* Your fiction only as successful as the characters in it
* Characters are the foreground of all fiction
* Interpret these notes super broadly and be creative with the interpretation

## Dialogue (speech)
* Attempts to marry logic to emotion, like fiction itself
* Simultaneously *characterize*, *set the scene*, *advance the action*, *foreshadow*, or *remind* (sloans law)
* Language reveals everything about a character
* **Read It aloud!**
### Ways of writing Dialogue
**Summary**
* Can be summarized as part of the narrative so that conversation is condensed

**Indirect**
* Can be reported in third person to carry the feel of exchange without quotes

**Direct Quotes**
* Use quotes to show someone talking  
#### Advice
* Can combine all three
* Use **Summary** or **Indirect** to get reader up to speed quickly
* Use **Direct Quotes** for more drama and direct action

* Not always grammatically correct
* Use your ear to write dialogue, free-write it if you can
### Action
* Contains possibility for change
    * Relationships
    * Tactics in conversation
    * Trying to get something
### Text & Subtext
* Characters might not say what they mean
* Human exchange is designed to conceal and reveal
* High emotions tamper with articulation
* Humans Tend to react to more what is implied than what is said
### "No" Dialogue
* Communicate more clearly if emphasis is on the speakers feelings
* "Details are the rocks that we throw at each-other" - Stephen Fisher
* Having "no" dialogue can advance conflict
### Pacing
* Let your characters surprise you
* Timing is very important
* Repetition can be useful
### Format & Style
* Meant to be invisible
* Can enhance for dramatic effect
* Put quotes for someone speaking, no quotes for someone thinking. Start with a new paragraph for that speaker
* Just say he said she said when ending direct quotes.
    * No he winced, she barked, he screamed.
    * You can tell by the language & the context
* Use adjectives instead of adverbs to describe how a character feels
* Use tags like "he said" in the middle of someone speaking to show a pause
* Dont use them in the beginning of someone speaking or when they've spoken too long
### Vernacular
* Avoid Misspellings
* Better conveyed by word choice than misspellings
## Appearance
* Use the senses to describe something
    * sight (strongest)
    * smell
    * sound
    * touch
    * taste
* using movement and position also describes something
## Action
* Change is the name of the game
    * Discover something
    * Make a choice
    * Go on chance
* Movement could setup a change, or build tension, or both
* Sudden changes provide big tension
## Thought
* Very similar to Dialogue, use those notes for this
* We don't need to show whats going on in thought, we can talk like dailogue (no quotes)

* Thinking is confusing with contradictory desires and wants
* We can control our behavior, not our thoughts
* Aristotle says, thinking is our way to step back from a goal to figure out how to achieve it
