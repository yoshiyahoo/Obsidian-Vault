### Main Questions
* Do you agree or disagree with Dr. Tysons argument that we have lost trust in science?
> I don't necessarily agree. I believe that because of the rise of social media and more online voices and opinions being heard that some people have exposed their ideas against science, and that enough people have subscribed to that level of thinking that's its become effective politically to campaign on that. I'm not saying people lost trust in science, I'm saying they never had trust in it to begin with.
* What do you think causes people to lose trust in science?
> Cultural reasons. Most likely religious rules or traditional family rules or something like that. I've always trusted science in part because my family are all scientists. My stubbornness and always wanting to question authority also play into that sure.
* What can we do, as academics and scientists, (yes you are an academic), to reestablish this trust?
> Make the spirit of science more accessable to the general public. Give people the oppertunity to try something they think is valuable or cool or interesting to study or build. Inspiring people to make changes in the workplace or in their family life, or getting people into the mindset that people can improve their lives in a meaningful way
* What aspects of the scientific method do you think are the most powerful?
> Peer review. I understand that people can take their projects emotionally and it can be hard to know what works and what doesn't. But having multiple people being able to review a project and come to a consensus is awesome

These questions also assume that science should be trusted and there could be something to say on that. Being critical of science and how it's conducted is important too
