# Bi-Pedalism
5-7mya
Early humans combined apelike & humanlike ways of moving around.
Gradual transition from trees to walking on ground
## Features
Foramen magnum can judge how bipedal smth is (hole in the skull, the more center, the more bipedal)
Inline big toe
Different pelvis & femur
Knees angle inward from the pelvis
## Why? 
* Efficient walking over long distances
* Reaching for food
* Could carry more things
* Changing world & Ecosystem (Forests breaking up, warmer place)
* Higher Field of vision
* Appearing larger and more intimidating

### Theories
1. Patchy forest hypothesis
2. Postural feeding hypothesis
	* 80% of chimpanzee bipedalism is during feeding
3. Provisioning hypothesis
4. Thermoregulatory model (increased heat loss, increased cooling. Reduced heat gain and reduced water req)
5. More energy efficient
