## Science Of Who We are And Where We Come From
* **Epistemes** are fundamental Cultural Assumptions
### Assumptions Of Science
* **Naturalism** assumes that the world divides into two categories
    a) The natural world of matter and law (we can focus on this)
    b) The supernatural world of spirit & miracle (we can't focus on this)
* **Rationalism** assumes miracles, or capricious (sudden or unaccountable) suspensions of the laws of nature, aren't explainable in the natural world, only historical processes are
* **Empiricism** assumes we learn about nature by collecting data in controlled conditions such that anyone could come to the same conclusion
* Fourth assumption is that maximum accuracy is the only goal of a good scientific explination
## Great Chain of Being (Western Europeans, gross)
* 4th Century BCE Greek Philospoher Aristotle
1. Simple to complex
2. Position Based on physical similarities
3. Linear Sequence
4. Hierarchy of Humans at the top
* World was seen as Fixed and Static
### Creationism
1. Christianity
2. Life on earth had been created by GOD exactly has it existed in the present
3. Since creation (4004 BCE) Irish arch Bishop James Usher (1581-1656)
    * Date of creation as the night preceding Sunday, 23 October 4004 BCE
### Argument By Design
1. Fitness and efficiency
2. Evert living thing seemed well adapted
3. Must have been designed from the outset by Intelligent creation (Intelligent Design)
## Intellectual Trends of the time (Western Europeans, gross)
### People
* John ray
    1. Proponent of the **Fixity of species** (a theory where species are fixed and don't change from how God created them)
    2. Distinguished groups of plants and animals by their ability to reproduce
* Carolus Linnaeus
    * **Standardization Taxonomy** system of classification used today
    1. Included humans in his classification although he thought us to be outside
    2. Binomial Nomenclature
        * Homo (genus) sapiens (species)
* Georges Comte de Buffon
    1. Stressed importance of change in nature
    2. Recognized that the **environment** was an important **agent of change**
* Jean-Baptiste Lamarck
    * 1st European scholar who tried to explain the evolutionary process
    1. Inherent drive for more complexity, bigger, better
    2. Influence of natural environment
    * Theory - Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics or the Use-Disuse (doesn't work)
    * Organic forms **could be altered** in the face of **changing environmental circumstances**
* Charles Lyell
    * Said the earth was really old, older than the bible described (1830's), took millions of years, changed Europeans thought
    * Europeans were found to have a stone age, living like the "savages" of more remote societies they found
    * Fossils found in nature couldn't have formed in the thousands of years of biblical time, they take much longer to form
    * Wrote *Principles of Geology*, considered the founder of modern geology
    * Coined **Uniformitarianism**
* Charles Darwin
    * Wrote the book on theory of natural selection
    * Super hesitant to post the theory, felt backlash would be bad
* Alfred Russel Wallace
    * Grew up working poor
    * Became self educated
    * Had the same theory of natural selection as Darwin, developed it independently
    * Disagreed with Darwin when it came to people in the theory
* Georges Cuiver 
    * Subscriped to Catastrophysm
    * Opposed Jean-Baptiste Lamark
* Thomas Malthus 
    * Wrote essay on the "Principal of Populations" inspired both Charles Darwin & Alfred Wallace
    * Said that one day europes population would increase faster than its food supply, causing starvation
### Other Terms
* **Extinction** is losing a species off the face of the earth (diminished as gods power)
    * Patterned, different creatures lived and died at different times, embedded in distinct geological formations
    * Evidence recovered as fossils
* People began comparing species to each-other, looking for similarities between them, instead of just comparing species to humans
    * Species categorized into groups, physical correspondents among different kinds of species is called **Homology**
* **Adaptations** are animals changes to fit their environment
    * The **Noah's Ark** story couldn't explain how all the animals got to their respective environments without dying. Those animals wouldn't have been adapted to the mountains of Ararat
* **Catastrophism** is the theory that extinction and the appearance of new species comes around after a huge disaster and a new creation. Geological features as well needed disasters to form
* **Monogenism** is the idea that all people share a common origin, precursor to the theory of evolution
* **Polygenism** is the idea that different peoples had different origins. (Used to justify slavery)
* **Uniformationism** is the theory that geological processes that happened a long time ago still happen today
    1. Soil takes immense geologic time to form
    2. Soil is formed through simple observable processes
    3. Can be explained due to Erosion
* Feudal system is still in place by the 18th century
* Bible was beginning to be reinterpreted in terms of narrative content, not historical content
## Transmutation Hypothesis / Precurser to Natural Selection
* Where did new species, adapted to their surroundings, come from?
1. Fossil Record - Sequence of Fossil types
    a) Large cats; animals survived the cataclysms
2. Existence of Rudimentary Organs
    a) Functionless organs
    b) Insects taht has small winds that were not used
3. Comparative anatomy - common ancestor hand is common example
4. Enbryological development
    a) as animals develooped in the fetus
    b) they resembled the adults forms of primitive types, human fetus has gill slits similar to fish
    c) inability to distinguish between types
5. Animal plant breeding - selective breeding could gice rise to new strains, once established could give rise to new forms
* **Transmutation Hypothesis** is that species come from older, other, similar species 
* **Descent with modification** came from Darwin seeing unusual alive animals that were very similar to unusual extinct ones
### Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection
* Cautious to publish the theory
* Influenced by geology
* No idea how to explain the variation of species
* **Natural Selection** is the process of the environment deciding which species survive and thrive and which don't 
    * Acts on individuals, population evolves
* ==**Artificial Selection**== is when humans pick the traits we want from certain animals
1. ==**Variation in fitness**== (ability to survive and reproduce)
    * Organisms in populations vary
2. ==**Selective Pressures**== are stress being put on a population, and nature decides what traits are best for survival & reproduction
    * Disease
    * Weather
    * Elevation
    * Other Species
3. ==**Favorable Traits**==
4. Beings don't have equal chances of surviving, they **compete** with each-other, driving adaptation
5. ==**Reproductive success**==, also known as **Fitness**
6. ==**Generational Change**==
* ==**Inheritance of Variation**== if the advantageous traits are inherited by offspring, these traits will become more common in succeeding generations
    * Disadvantageous traits become less relevant until they may be needed again
* This is evolutionary biology, not human history
## Post Darwin Theories & Disputes
* ==**Blending Inheritance**== is when a child is a mix of it's parents
* **Social Darwinism**
    * General terms for any evolutionary arguments about biological basis of human differences
    * Originated in the class stratification of England, yet pervasive throughout Europe and U.S.
    * Notions of fitness, competition, and biological rationalizations of inequality were popular
* **Eugenics**
    * Coined in 1883 by English scientist Francos Galton, a cousing of Charles Darwin
    * Ideal of perfecting the human race, as he put it, getting rid of "undesirables" while multiplying its "desirables"
## Molecular Evolution (Microevolution)
* **Micro Evolution** is a change in the frequency of genes/**alleles** within a gene pool from one generation to the next
    * An **Allele** is one or two more forms of a gene.
* **Gene Flow** is taking one population and mixing with another
* **Genetic Drift** is a subset of a population shielding themselves from everyone else (the royal family lol)
    * Their genes don't mix with others, certain genetic traits are carried on at a higher rate (idiots)
* **Mutation** Copies of genes get screwed up and do something different, body tries to limit this
* **Recombination** 
    * Chromosomes can switch or change alleles with each-other through meiosis
    * Causes variation

# Macroevolution
* major evolutionary change, evolution of groups larger than an individual
## Organismal and Multilevel Evolution
* **Macro evolution** is changing from one species to another
