# Different Groups
Ardipithecus group
Paranthropus group
* Restricted ranges, walkers & climbers
* Didn't spread genes very far

Australopithecus group
Homo group (us are here)

# Pre-Homo species
4.2 - 1mya
1. Mixed arboreal habitat
2. Bi-pedal Walker/Climber
3. Small brains +10-15% over chimpanzees
4. Stone tools appear late
5. Accelerated development
6. Diet- Plants not meat was the major nourishment

# Skull
Prognathism (Face is projecting further out, instead of being flat) As we evolve, were less prognastic
Supra Orbital Arch (built in sunglasses, get more subdued as we evolve)
Occipital Crest or Nuchal Torus (connection point in the back of the skull with our neck)
Football skull transforms into more of a circular skull as we evolve
In filling at the brain is at the front of the skull inbetween our two eye orbits
# Homo Genus
## Environmental Pulses
* Environment is causing changes to come in homo genus
* Environment changes rapidly, forcing us to be nimble, to migrate around. Warm periods and cold periods
* Out of Africa events occur during the warmer periods, when desert areas constrict down and are more grassland
## Homo Habilis
2.5mya - 1.4mya?
1. Increased use of material culture (tools)
2. Larger brain, 20% increase
3. Smaller Teeth
4. Australopithecus-like body

## Homo Erectus
1.8m or 2m - 300k years ago (long lived and successful)
Nearly indistinguishable from a modern human, except for the brain.
Lived in diverse environments and covered wide territory
Veg and meat
Cooperative and sharing
Division of labor
1. Larger Brain
2. Tool user
3. Body (upper and lower) similar to Homo Sapiens
4. Long distance runner
5. Out of Africa
6. Variation among population

### Physical Traits
1. 100lbs
2. 5' 6''
3. Sexually dimorphic
	* Nariokotome "Turkana" Boy
		* Skeleton of 8 year old, was 5' 3'', would've been 6'
		* 880cc - 909cc
1. Brain capacity 700-11,250 cc (900 cc)
2. 25 - 40% increase in average capacity
3. Small groups
4. Primarily Gathering w/Hunting
5. Opportunistic Scavenging

### Out Of Africa
Europe sucked because it was cold in the winter.
First, Africa
Second, Middle east, turkey
Third, South Asia, South East Asia, Indonesia
Forth, East Asia, China
Fifth, Europe
Water was a barrier that couldn't be crossed


### Culture
Quick adaptation to environmental changes
1. First appearance of hominids outside of Africa
2. First appearance of systematic hunting
3. Tool making and use of fire
4. First indication of extended childhood
5. Capable of a more complex life

## Interesting Sites
Dnamsis, Republic of Georgia
1.75mya

Individuals found
1. Less-robust and thinner brow ridge
2. Projecting (prognastic) face
3. Relatively large canine
4. More related to earlier homo than Homo erectus
5. Smaller brain size, 550cc-780cc
6. Only 4'9'' - 5'5'' tall
7. Oldowan like tools

Zhoukoudian, China (Near Beijing)
Homo Erectus Found.

Java, Indonesia
1.6 - 1 mya
Individuals between 1.3 - 1 mya
1969 discovery

Atapuerca, Spain
1.2 mya

Gran Dolina Site, Spain 850-780k years ago

Cerpano Sit, Central italy
900-800k years ago

## Use Of Fire
Caves are only reliable way to find humans utilizing fire, since natural fires happen all the time

burned plants and bones from 1mya

Brains take up a lot of calories. Meat is high in calories. Cooking meat means less energy spent digesting

Culture could be influenced by fire. Women teach children
