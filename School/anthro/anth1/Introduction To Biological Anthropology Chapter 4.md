# George Mendel
* (1822-1884)
* Trained as a statistician
* Messed around with pea plants
* Father of genetics
* Sucked at titles

1. Relatively unknown researcher
2. ==Contemporary== of Darwin, yet they ==never communicated==
3. Studied hybridization or better said inheritance of traits

* 1900, research aimed at finding a successful theory of ==Discontinuous inheritance== rather than ==blending inheritance==
	* Some genes directly control a trait and can't be mixed together

* Developed genotypic understanding of hereditary

* ==Phenotypes== means physical appearance
* ==Genotype== means genetic makeup

### First Experiment
1. Took tall plants and bred them with small plants, creating all tall plants creating ==hybrids== (TT) + (tt) = (Tt), (Tt), (Tt), (Tt)
2. Cross bred all the hybrid plants, 3/4 were tall plants, 1/4 other was a small plant, (Tt) + (Tt) = (TT), (Tt), (Tt), (tt) 

* Realized genes travel in pairs. Genes are general traits like how tall something is, Alleles are more specific like tall or short

#### Punnett Square

Generation 1, T = tall Dominant Gene, t = short recessive trait

|  | T | T |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| t | Tt | Tt |
| t | Tt | Tt |  
Genotype = Tt 100%
Phenotype = All Tall

|  | T | t |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| T | TT | Tt |
| t | Tt | tt |  
Genotype = TT 25%, Tt 50%, tt 25%
Phenotype = 75% tall, 25% short

* ==Homozygous== means you have two of the same traits
* ==Heterozygous== means you have two opposite traits

# Different Types of Traits
1. Discrete/Discontinuous/Mendel's
	* Controlled by only 1 genetic locus
	* phenotypic expressions don't overlap
2. Co-dominant
	* 2 traits may be present or dominant
3. Sex Linked
	* Examples, colorblind, baldness
	* Carried in X chromosome of humans
4. Polygenic/Continuous
	* Traits that have a total range of phenotypic expression,
	* Graded or a spectrum of continuous variation
	* All physical traits (Skin color, height, statue, hair color, Shape of face/nose/ears)

# Processes that Produce and Redistribute Variation (Microevolution)
Evolution is a two step process
1. Production and redistribution of variation
2. Natural Selection acting on this variation

* Mutation
	* Genetic material modified
	* Most occur in a gamete, since it needs to be passed on
	* Rate is very low
	* Only way to produce "new" variation
* Recombination
	* Doesn't change allele frequencies or cause evolution
	* Changes the composition of parts of chromosomes
	* affects how some genes act, and slight changes of gene function become material for natural selection to act upon
* Natural Selection
	* Gene Flow
		1. Exchange of genes between populations
		2. Movement of people resulting in interbreeding
		3. Social factors determine mating patterns
		4. Constant feature of hominoid evolution is migration and interbreeding, thus the overall gene pool is constantly remixing, hindering isolation We are social beings, drawn to difference.
	 * Genetic Drift
		1. A shift in allele frequency, usually random due to sampling or population size
		2. Types of drift
			a) Population bottleneck
			b) Founder Effect

Evolution can be most succinctly defined as ==the change in allele frequencies from one generation to the next==

==**Founder Effect**== is the reduced genetic diversity which results when a population is descended from a small number of colonizing ancestors
