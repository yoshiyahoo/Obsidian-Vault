# Evolution & Behavior
Behavior becomes a strat for reproductive success & survival of the group as well as the individual.
==Cooperation== as a behavior is more important for group survival than the individual.

### Models for Studying
A. Socioecology
* Focuses on relationship between social behavior and natural environment
* Favors selection for individual's daily survival
B. Sociobiology
* Biology and Behavior intertwined
* Focuses on genetic predisposition to behaviors and those behaviors' enhancement of reporoductive success

Systems of biology, environment, and culture are connected to each-other.

## Evolution of Behavior
Behavior constitutes a **phenotype**
* Individuals who's behavioral phenotypes increase reproductive fitness pass on their genes at a faster rate.
* Sex is probably the biggest driving force in primate behavior
* Species vary in their limits and potentials for learning and behavioral flexibility, set by genetic factors.

Group living exposes animals to competition with other group members
* Costs of competition are offset by benefits of predator defense provided by associating with others
* Group living evolved as an adaptive response to a number of ecological variables.

### Dominance Hierarchies
Many primate societies are organized into **dominance hierarchies** that impose order and establish parameters of individual behavior
* Higher-ranking animals have greater access to preferred food items and mating partners than lower ranking individuals
* Dominance hierarchies are sometimes called "pecking orders" that change throughout one's life and are _learned_

### Affiliative Behaviors
Reconciliation, Reassurance, consolation, and friendly interactions. (Behaviors that reinforce relationships. Strengthens the group)
* Doing favors and paying attention to other people gets you favors.
* Express dominance, greet, warn about predator
#### Physical Contact
* (hugging, hand holding, touching, kissing)
#### Grooming
* reinforces social bonds
* promotes peace in social groups

#### Altruism
* Helping others without getting something in return
* Bonds between individuals can last a lifetime
* Non-Human primates forms alliances: two or more animals join together for a common purpose.
