# What it is
Mechanism which allows bacteria to record which viruses they have been exposed to

Genetic Vaccination Card

Forms something called a CAS-9 RNA complex.
* CAS-9 is a protein that matches the bound RNA to DNA sequences in the cell
* Can recognize particular DNA sequences and cut them out with *extreme* precision
* *Programmable*

Wherever the CAS-9 finds a match, it will cut the DNA at that point

Relatively simple & easy to use compared to other gene editing technologies

# Potential Uses
Can be used in human cells 

Causes cells to repair DNA
Cells Repair Cuts in two ways
* Patch the two remaining ends of DNA together, slightly modifying the genome
* Integrating another piece of DNA into the genome

Can fix bad mutations in embryos
Can make people faster, stronger, more attractive
