# DNA De-oxyribo Nucleic-Acid
* Spiral Staircase (Double Helix), easy to store, highly compactable
* Made up of a sugar & phosphate walls with nucleotide base pairs
* Four nucleotides, Adenine & Thymine, Guanine & Cytosine. Phosphate bonds and sugar line the edges. Has nitrogenous base.
* A = T, C = G. Always Think that College is Good (mnemonic)
* A ==gene== is a sequence of base pairs that codes for reproduction of a protien
* Discovered by Rosalind Franklin

## Characteristics
1. Extremely Stable and Durable
2. Long term storage of information
3. Simple yet complex in its interaction
4. Set of blueprints, like a recipe or a code
5. Contains the instructions needed to construct other components of cells
6. All living organisms share similar DNA code as a result of our common evolutionary history
* Size of genome doesn't necessarily reflect complexity

## Chromosomes
* A form of DNA that looks like an long tube
* Two chromosomes together look like an X

## DNA Replication
* A = T, C = G are linked together by hydrogen bonds
### Enzymes
* To replicate, these bonds are broken and DNA is unwounded into two pieces by an enzyme called ==helicase==
* Enzyme called ==DNA Polymerase== uses the DNA strands as templates to add new nucleotides to the strands
* ==Primase== guids DNA Polymerase to where it needs to replicate DNA
* ==Ligase== glues DNA fragments together
### 3' & 5'
* How DNA is structured
![](DNA_3prime_5prime.png)
* DNA Polymerase can only run 3' to 5' way
### Process
1. Origin point established
2. Helicase breaks bonds
3. Primase sets RNA primers for DNA Polymerase, needs extra primers for 5' to 3' direction, has missing pieces, forming fragments
4. DNA Polymerase adds the missing nucleotides to both seperated strands, rarely makes mistakes
    * ==Leading Strand==, strand easy to do, 3' to 5'
    * ==Lagging Strand==, strand hard to do, 5' to 3'
5. Ligase fixes missing pieces in lagging strand

# Cells
* Eukaryote cells have a nucleus
* Prokaryote cells don't 
* ==Zygotes== are two sex cells combined together (a fertilized egg as an ex)
* Humans have 46 chromosomes
    * Sex chromosomes are X & Y
    * one X one Y in men, two X's in women
* Chimps and Gorillas have 48 chromosomes

## Cell Phases
* Interphase, (cell replicates DNA, does other buisness)
* Mitosis, regular (somatic) cells replicate (DNA does not replicate here)
    * Stages
        * Early prophase
        * Late prophase
        * Metaphase 
        * Anaphase
        * Telophase
    * Starts with 46 duplicated Chromosomes, ends with 46 singular chromosomes
        * copies seperate as cells divide
    * Produces two identical daughter cells
* Meiosis, sex cells replicate 
    * Stages
        * Metaphase 1, first cell division
        * Metaphase 2, second cell division
    * Starts with one cell with 46 duplicated chromosomes
    * Four daughter cells with 23 chromosomes in each cell
* ==Nondisjunction== happens when homologous (copied) chromosomes don't seperate properly

# Genetics
* Our DNA has three main functions
    1. Replication, Make a copy of itself
    2. Decoding of genetic information (makes a protein)
    3. Transmission of this information across generations
* A gene is a sequence of nucleotide base pairs that encode a protein that the **Ribosome** decodes

* ==Polymerase chain reaction== uses small copies of DNA segments as a starting template to make millions of copies


## Cell Replication
* Cells have a life cycle
* 2 types of cells
    * Somatic Cells
        * cellular components of body tissues
    * Sex Cells (Gametes)
* 2 types of replication
    * Mitosis (Somatic Cell division)
        * End up with exact copies of parent
    * Meiosis (Sex Cell division)
        * End up with 4 Daughter cells with half the DNA

# Proteins
* Major structural component of the body
* String of amino acids
* Serve as catalysts - initiate and enhance chemical reactions
* 3-D molecules,  ability to bind to other molecules
Examples
* Hemoglobin - in red blood cells bind oxygen which in  turn transports oxygen to cells throughout the body
* Hormones - influence chemical reactions and regulate various cellular functions

## Amino Acids
* Encodes all proteins
* 20 in total
* 8 you get from eating food, the rest you get from your body

## Protein Synthesis
* Ribosome manufactures protein
* Double Stranded DNA trapped in the nucleus needs to get out
* 2 step process to make proteins
    1. Transcription
        * Builds RNA, DNA with A = U & C = G
        * DNA is cut in two
        * RNA copy generated from DNA
        * Single stranded RNA, (mRNA) let out of Nucleus
    2. Translation
        * mRNA heads towards Ribosome, directs
        * tRNA (transfer RNA) carries an amino acid to the ribosome, builds protein
        * 3 nucleotides encodes one amino acid, (codon)
            * tRNA matches to the codon, and drops off amino acid
            * more than one codon that codes for same amino acid
        * As the mRNA is read and translated, amino acids stick together to form the protein, uses a peptide bond to do so
        * when STOP codon reached, protein is complete
* Reads only 3% of the message, this portion called ==exons== which encode a protein, the rest are ==introns== which are lines of code that don't encode for a protein

## Epigenome
* ==Genome== is all the genes in your DNA
* ==Epigenome== (above the genome) is all the stuff around the DNA or attached to your DNA
	* Methyl Groups or Methyl Bonds
		* Shut off genes
	* Histones-Tags
	    * Influence how genes are expressed
* Epigenome might change
	* Changes from what we eat, what we smoke, etc
