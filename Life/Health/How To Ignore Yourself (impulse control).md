# Story of Arjun & Krishna (major steps to ignoring yourself)

Arjun is about to go to war against his cousins and teachers and he doesn't want to fight.

Krishna (his charioteer) tells Arjun that he understands, but, he says that fleeing the field of battle and ==following your negative emotions== is what **actually leads you to more suffering**

> You are fighting your cousins and teachers for a reason (they're jerks or smth), *and if you don't fight them (run away)*, they will keep coming for you
> **Resisting the impulse is going to be the foundation of taking the right action**

Krishna claims that anytime we have a negative impulse or emotion, *if we do nothing about that*, the impulse will go away, and our emotions will return to a normal or **homeostasis**.

## Examples of letting your emotions control you

1. Lets say I'm socially anxious about going to parties
    * I decide to stay home and give in to the awkwardness
    * Sooner or later, I get lonely
    * I start to feel pathetic for not having friends, Even if I go to the party, I'll still feel those things
    * If I force myself to go, it will be really hard, I'll struggle to make friends, all that
    * Repeat

2. Lets say I want a perfect wedding (I'm a groomzilla) and it isn't perfect
    * I harbor some resentment
    * That resentment sows the seeds for a future divorce
    * The divorce happens within 1-3 years

## Doing the right thing is actually two key steps

1. Resist the impulse to do the wrong thing *what we are lacking*
2. Do the right thing

> No one thinks that hey I didn't screw up today as an important step towards my goals right 
> that's not actually making progress that's just doing nothing and doing nothing isn't progress
> so we don't even try to do it, and this is the **huge mistake** that we make

> every person I have worked with who has conquered addictions 
> has made the very fundamental step of ***doing nothing*** and learning
> how to ignore their desires and how to ignore their impulses

## How to resist & ignore impulses (stoics & yogi stuff)

1. Follow the timeline of your desires and learn the cost of giving into your impulses
    * what actually happens overtime when you give in to your impulses? Really study that
        * this requires focus and attention
2. Meditation or mindfulness exercices (Examples)
    * resist the temptation to move when getting tickled by a feather
    * *fixed point gazing*, stare at a candle and don't blink, resist any impulses that come
    * don't order your most favorite food at a restaurant, order your second or third favorite, resist the impulse
