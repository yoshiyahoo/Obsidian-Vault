> There's a fear of becoming what we felt like we always should be that's holding us back.

==Jonah Syndrome==
* Fear of success or the fear of being one's best.
* This fear prevents self actualization, or the realization of one's own potential.
* It is the fear of one's own greatness, the evasion of one's destiny, or the avoidance of exercising one's talents.

==Sorrow== is from the moments where we have confronted the reality of the world.
The pain we fear the most. The product of involuntarily encountering the world as is.
==Fear== is our attempt to control sorrow.
> When you didn't have a framework, when you didn't have a somebody-ness, you were just part of the universe, and there was no fear. One has to have self-concept to be afraid, and when an organism is functioning instinctively in a scene, as an infant, each change in the homeostasis, each change in the balance of the situation is just a new moment. It's just a new moment to which it responds. - Ram Dass


Don't control the sorrow, accept it and feel it for what it is.

To die is to live without a future, without a tomorrow. To find out what it means to die is to live without fear.
