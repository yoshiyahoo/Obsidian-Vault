Relationships are always between two people 
# Attachment Theory
As children, we don't know what our internal feelings are
We understand them through ==emotional mirroring== of the adults around us

Ex:
A toddler is playing and then falls down. If the adults get shocked, the toddler cries. If the adults laugh, the toddler laughs

## Strange Situation Experiment
A mom and a kid are in a room.
Mom leaves the room and a stranger enters.
Mom eventually comes back into the room.
Noted the kids reaction to mom leaving and coming back.

## Different Attachment Types 
1. ==Secure==
    * Cry when mom leaves, easily comforted when she's back
    * Confident, brave, intrinsically motivated

> Every time I get hurt mom is there and comforting

2. ==Anxious-Ambivalent==
    * Sends mixed signals (external & internal)
    * Feels inner turmoil and upset, and feels stupid for feeling that way
    * Might say one thing when they mean another
    * Doesn't understand why they're upset or angry
    * Low amount of intrinsic Motivation
        * Always on the fence
    * Resistant attachment (I'm attached but not thrilled about it)

> When Caregivers give inconsistent responses to care. Sometimes mom is super caring, other times she isn't

3. ==Anxious-Avoidant==
    * Unruffled in face of separation
        * May appear strong, internally in distress
    * Remain independent, even when they are upset
    * Won't go to mom for comfort or security
    * Numb, cold
    * Has a place they like to hang out, safe zone
    * Keeps you at arms length, not too close, not too far, safe zone
        * Very unsatisfying
        * Paradoxical limbo zone, not too close, but maybe you wanna be closer
    * Protection against emotional hurt
    * Gonna be really bad at communicating emotions

> When parents response to you is not influenced by your emotional needs. When your needs do not get a proper response from parents. Emotional needs rebuffed.

4. ==Insecure==
    * Cry when mom leaves, keeps crying when mom returns
    * Inconsolable

> Every time I get hurt mom isn't comforting (more complex)

## How to change your attachment style to a secure
* Foundations are not fate
    * Early style determined by parents, but it matters less and less as you age
* People play an active role in shaping your personal environments
    * The people you pick to hang with determines your attachment style
    * Hanging out with secure people makes you more secure

* Communicate your feelings directly, even if half baked
    * This is hard b/c you should be able to have it figured out
    * Gives other person the opportunity to be confused with you
    * Be Honest!

* Attachment style is about ==emotional mirroring==

* Acknowledge your emotional needs, even if you don't know those feelings yet
    * Even the ones that seem stupid, Acknowledge those!
    * Other people don't need to change their behavior!
