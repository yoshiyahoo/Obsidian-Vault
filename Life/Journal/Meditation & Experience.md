[Dr K video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86sYinrLuPA&t)
* The post breathing is the most Important part
* Run with the anxious mind for a little, and slow down. It will slow down with you
### Experiences
#### My First Experience
> I felt pretty relaxed and kinda nebulous. Feels nice
> Nothing really insane tho, but that's fine. Maybe the first one isnt super crazy or whatever idk
> I'm excited to do the next one, and maybe it won't be as boring I guess

#### My Second Experience 
> I felt very relaxed, like a little kid jumping in a grassy field
> Not a care in the world, dancing, enjoying, doing stuff like that
